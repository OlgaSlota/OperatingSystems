# OperatingSystems
c language implementations of system mechanisms used from user level

cw01 Memory management , libraries and time measurement:
1) List implementation with basic functionalities as an addres book.
2) Using implemented list as a ready library - 3 different solutions : static , dynamic , shared.

cw02 IO operations
1) Implementing insertion sort on files to compare library and system functions efficiency. 
2) Directory structure operations. Walking through the file tree ( comparison of 2 methods).
3) File locking ( read/ write , mandatory/advisory).

cw03 Process operations
1) Creating and testing behavior of processes ( fork / vfork / clone with different arguments).
2) Creating some kind of child processes tree ( while file tree walk ).
